# RGB Color Guessing Game

I saw something like this and wanted to recreate it as a way to practice basic Javascript logic and also as a way to show students who are new to javascript how making small games is a great way to improve HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. I tried to write the JS in a way that could be looked at by people who are relatively new to Javascript so they could dissect the what, why and how. (If you are unfamiliar with recursion then beware the last function on line 66, I couldn't resist adding it).

Feel free to download, clone, fork or do whatever you want with this repo. Maybe set out to recreate it without looking at the code. One thing I was told when learning JS for practice is to go through each line of code and add your own comments, then delete all the code and try to rewrite the JS based off your comments. Also, with this project I set out to not use any global variables but if you are new to JS then I wouldn't worry about using a global variable to store the correct RGB value.

As a front end kind of guy it pains me to show something that has such barebones aesthetics but i decided to keep it in this state to show what your first version of a game/idea will be like. I start with creating just the most basic amount of html and css that then allows me to create the javascript game logic. This is designed to show you what the first version would look like (I even left the guidance borders on that I usually delete later). A common problem new devs make, myself included, is focusing too much on making something look good before it even works, which can make things harder down the road.

### Now that it is in it's most basic form the next thing to decide is: 

*What features would I like to add to the game? Additional features will mean revisiting, refactoring and adding to the Javascript. Changes to html and css will also be needed depending on the feature.
(I can already think of certain lines of code that could have been handled better, specifically line 47, but opted to leave it in).

*What do I want the app to look like/ How can I make this look better? This means visiting the world of CSS, pondering color schemes, enhancing the UI, thinking about how to make this responsive, etc.

I reckon I will make some updated versions and detail the process, let me know what you think. Feel free to reach out on slack or via contactjacobtay@gmail.com
